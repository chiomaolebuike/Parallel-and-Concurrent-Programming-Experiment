# Parallel-and-Concurrent-Programming-Experiment
This project focuses on parallelizing a serial algorithm using multithreading with proper synchronization via join(). Validated correctness and benchmarked performance across varying input sizes. Generated speedup graphs and profiling results on both local and departmental servers.
