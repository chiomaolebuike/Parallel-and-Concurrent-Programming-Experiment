# Parallel-and-Concurrent-Programming-Experiment
A project to implement a parallel version of an existing serial algorithm using threading and join() for synchronization. The goal is to achieve correctness and measurable speedup over the serial implementation. Includes profiling, benchmarking, and validation to compare performance across different input sizes. Generates speedup graphs and performance analysis on local and departmental server environments.
